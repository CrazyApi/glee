				<div class="entry-content">
<p>I just discovered that it takes one click in Windows 7 to pack all
my wallpapers, sound scheme, and Aero color scheme into a single file,
and another click to load it onto another Win7 PC. Given that
information, I just had to create a pack of my own. Lo and behold,
here’s a themepack with all my favorite wallpapers that I’ve acquired
over months of idle time, along with my favorite Aero color scheme
(Gray), and my favorite sound scheme (As few as possible). If it
interests you, here’s the link:</p>

<p><a href="http://sameerahuja.com/files/SA.themepack">SA.themepack</a></p>

<p>Be warned though, it’s huge (~89MB). It has several wallpapers, and
they are as super-high-resolution as I could get. The wallpapers are
all from publicly available sources, and I’ve been careful to not
include any restricted content. However, remembering all the sources
I’ve acquired them from is beyond my human capacity, so let’s just
thank the Internets for them. If you own the rights to a wallpaper in
the pack and would like me to remove it or to credit you in this post,
please send me an email using the contact page, and I’ll do that in a
jiffy.</p>

<p>Oh, and when you get to <em>END</em> wallpaper, please excuse me for it. You know I had to do it.</p>

<p><em>“I am going to just go back to <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/India" title="India" rel="wikipedia">India</a>. I’m just not responsible enough to do anything worthwhile.”</em></p>

<p>As I stood sweating in the hot summer sun waiting for the 3PM Tom’s
Creek A to arrive, I could not seem to find words degrading enough to
describe myself. This was my second day in <a class="zem_slink" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blacksburg%2C_Virginia" title="Blacksburg, Virginia" rel="wikipedia">Blacksburg, Virginia</a>.
And I had concluded that I was going back to where I came from. You
see, when I came here, I came with the understanding that out of
everything that I possessed, there was just one thing that was critical
to my presence. My passport. This understanding had been ingrained in
my mind by my father’s persistence in repeating it to me, even at the
cost of me mocking him every time he did so, once every couple of hours
for each day of the week before I actually left India.</p>

<p>And so I stood there; now almost soaking wet from all the sweat in
that hot, hot summer sun; trying to avoid the realization of the
enormity of the fact that I had lost my passport on my <strong>second day</strong> at <a class="zem_slink" href="http://www.vt.edu/" title="Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University" rel="homepage">Virginia Tech</a>.
Earlier in the day I had found that the passport wasn’t in its natural
habitat: The leather pouch in the inner pocket of the document holder I
kept in my backpack. Since then, I had traced every step I took the day
before. I mean that literally. I had searched the dorm room I stayed
at, the laundry room of the dorms, the pavements that I had walked, all
the paths on drillfield (I didn’t remember the one I had walked on),
and of course, the empty apartment I was going to stay in before I lost
the only document that I was not supposed to lose. I had given up on
the search.</p>

<p>I went back to the apartment and lied down on the bare floor next to
the two trolley bags, the backpack and the handbag that represented
everything that I had brought with me to the States. Everything except
the only thing that I wasn’t supposed to lose. I tried replaying the
last day for one last time in my head. No luck. I was as doomed as
Windows Me was the day it released. Well, maybe not <em>that</em> much.</p>

<p>But I digress. Having resigned to my fate, I tried to go to sleep.
Now the part from here to what happened next is a gray area in my
memory. But here’s what I do remember: I woke up shouting “The Bag!”. I
opened the zip of the front document pocket of the larger bag. It was
empty. I opened the zip of the front document pocket of the smaller
trolley bag. There, at the bottom of the pocket, my fingers touched the
leathery material that makes up the cover of all passports issued by
the Indian Republic.</p>

<p>The next few moments are hard to describe. So I won’t. Suffice to say, I really <strong>was</strong> the happiest person on the planet for those moments.</p>

<p>This is what had happened: When I had arrived in Blacksburg, my
baggage didn’t arrive with me – it had been lost in one of the 547
transfers you need to make when coming to Roanoke Regional Airport from
anywhere else in the world. Fortunately, the airlines found my bags
soon enough. On the evening the day before, the airlines had called me
and told me that they were sending the bags at the apartment. When I
received the bags, I had to show the personnel my ID. The only ID I had
on me was my passport. So I took it out of its natural habitat to show
it to the personnel. They gave me the bags and went away.</p>

<p>Now these were heavy bags, filled beyond their legal limits. One
person couldn’t lift them both together. Ideally, I should have taken
them in one by one. But having lived in big Indian cities for all 25
years of my life, my brain was conditioned to believe that you never
leave <strong>anything</strong> unattended. Anywhere.</p>

<p>So I had to pull in the two trolley bags together, one in each hand.
But I was holding the passport in one of my hands. I could keep it in
one of the pockets of my Jeans, but that might bend it. This was the
most important document in my possession, I couldn’t let it be bent.
Umm, wait, I’ll keep it in the front pocket of one of these bags. It’ll
be safe there. Later, I’ll take it out and put it in its natural
habitat. And then, something happened. I went in, and completely forgot
about taking the passport out of the bag. Hell, I even forgot I put it
there.</p>

<p>Well, now that this trauma was over, that night I went out of the
apartment to the nearby park to watch the stars in the sky. I come from
Delhi – I’m blown away whenever I can see anything more than the moon
in the night sky. As I was watching the stars, I thought to myself –
lesson well learnt. In the future, I would not let magical moments
dictate my life, and no matter what happens, I would <strong>always</strong> keep documents where they belong.</p>

<p>Now, you must be thinking – “I read through this whole post just to
read that? I mean, that’s a pretty bland story.” To which let me
respond by saying that its less bland than <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOwPGqIzNwQ">watching kittens sleep for three minutes in a YouTube video</a>
– an activity I’m sure you’ve indulged in before. But anyways, the
story doesn’t end there. I wish, oh god I wish, that it did. But it
doesn’t. In the course of the next two years, I managed to (really)
lose my passport once, and my I-20 twice. Over the course of these
mishaps, my sense of self-deprecation has mellowed, and I’ve come to
accept things for what they really are. Today, as I get ready to finish
up with my degree and get started with the next chapter of my life, I
still remember vividly that second day in Blacksburg, and often think
of the real moral of my story – “Shit happens.”</p>

				<div class="entry-content">
<p>I’m a heavy user of TextMate, and use the <a href="http://blog.macromates.com/2006/blogging-from-textmate/">blogging bundle</a>
to create and edit posts. I’m also a heavy user of Wordpress Pages that
enable wordpress to be used as a CMS. The one issue that always bugs me
with any new Wordpress installation is that you cannot edit pages from
XML-RPC blogging tools like TextMate, Ecto, Windows Live Writer and
such. The only working solution I’ve found to the same is a <em>little</em> ugly: You’ll need to edit one of the core wordpress files. I wouldn’t do it if I didn’t love TextMate so much.</p>

<p><a href="http://maisonbisson.com/blog/post/10834/editing-wordpress-pages-via-xml-rpc/">This post</a>
from Maison Bisson described the process of editing the files for a
previous version. The good news is, for the latest Wordpress releases
(I’ve checked 2.7.0 and 2.7.1), the data model has been changed to
remove the “static” post status for pages (They now have the same
status codes as posts), which means that no changes are required to the
update fundtion; and a field called post_type now stores information
about the kind of post (blog post, page, attachment).</p>

<p>So, essentially, here’s all you need to do to magically get the list of latest posts AND pages on your blogging client:</p>

<p>Modify this query in <code>wp_includes/post.php</code>:
</p><div class="syntaxhighlighter nogutter " id="highlighter_255373"><div class="lines"><div class="line alt1"><code class="number">1.</code><span class="content"><span class="block" style="margin-left: 0px ! important;"><code class="variable">$sql</code> <code class="plain">= </code><code class="string">"SELECT * FROM $wpdb-&gt;posts WHERE post_type = 'post' ORDER BY post_date DESC $limit"</code><code class="plain">;</code></span></span></div></div></div>

<p>to this:</p>

<p></p><div class="syntaxhighlighter nogutter " id="highlighter_533041"><div class="lines"><div class="line alt1"><code class="number">1.</code><span class="content"><span class="block" style="margin-left: 0px ! important;"><code class="variable">$sql</code> <code class="plain">= </code><code class="string">"SELECT * FROM $wpdb-&gt;posts WHERE post_type = 'post' OR post_type = 'page' ORDER BY post_date DESC $limit"</code><code class="plain">;</code></span></span></div></div></div>

<p>This is a scotch-tape solution that’s worked well for me so far. Try
it at your own risk. Also, remember that when you update your Wordpress
installation, these changes might get overwritten.</p>

<p>Since my body and mind are refusing to do any productive work today,
I thought I’ll spend some time to post this thought that has been
ringing in my head for quite a while. As is pretty clear these days to
any <a href="http://www.gapingvoid.com/Moveable_Type/archives/004719.html">social media specialist</a>,
there is a very strong personal identity management aspect to the web
today. The first thing that any HR worth his/her salt will do on
receiving your resume, for example, is google your name. Secondly, they
might use tools like <a href="http://pipl.com/">Pipl</a>, <a href="http://www.123people.com/">123People</a> or <a href="http://www.spokeo.com/">Spokeo</a> to get deeper insights into what you’ve been up to on the web. If you’re on <a href="http://www.friendfeed.com/">friendfeed</a>,
you can make their task a little easier and aggregate your online
activities at one place. And, all of us are generating tons of stuff on
the web for these services to aggregate and search. Try searching for
your name on Pipl. If you are in the core demographic of the people who
read this blog, I bet that you’ll find something in the results that
you didn’t expect to see. And you can’t delete it.</p>

<p>And that’s the thing about the web and social applications, which is
not necessarily bad, but its something that not everyone understands.
It’s hard to remove your footprints.</p>

<p>Which brings me to what I really wanted to share in this post. It’s
an imaginary scenario that popped into my head the day I installed <a href="http://ankitahuja.com/blog/webapps/twitkut/">Twitkut</a> on my <a href="http://www.orkut.com/">Orkut</a>
profile. (Disclaimer: The author of the app is my younger brother. I am
giving his app free publicity here in the hope that he’ll stop asking
me for a MacBook for Christmas.) It’s an app that shows my tweets on my
orkut profile and in my orkut update stream. As soon as I installed the
app, I realized that it wasn’t the smartest idea in the world. You see,
I post a lot of stuff on twitter that I expect only a small set of
people to read. I know any one can read all of my posts by simply going
to <a href="http://twitter.com/sam33r">my twitter home</a>, but I
don’t expect them to care enough to go there, or to even know enough
about me to go there. I certainly don’t expect my mom to go there. And
I know she never will. She’s a normal person who uses a computer only
for utilitarian purposes that include email, skype and browsing photos.
That’s it. And Twitter, as a <a href="http://perez.cs.vt.edu/">smart person I know</a>
once said, Twitter is still this underground movement in the whole
scheme of things, and sometimes its surprising to the ‘tweeter’, as it
may, when a more mainstream audience gets access to and comments on the
tweet.</p>

<p>Now, Orkut is a social network that is becoming increasingly and
scarily mainstream in India. I have school friends, ex-bosses, cousins,
relatives and even past teachers as friends on Orkut. (I have <a href="http://twitter.com/mapq">my advisor</a>
as a friend on Twitter, but that’s another story) And my tweets aren’t
meant to be read by all of these people. Especially the relatives.
Because that brings them from the online social domain to the very
active Ahuja family network domain. Here’s a potential scenario:</p>

<p>I’m willing to be my guinea pig and wait for this to happen some
day. When it does, I promise to report in full detail. Till then, enjoy
tweeting and friend-feeding, and remember to keep forgetting to keep
those wild party pics private. It’s so much more fun to browse through
photos when you know you are not meant to see them.</p>

<p>I read <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/Terror_strikes_Delhi_30_killed_in_5_blasts/articleshow/3479914.cms">the news of the blasts</a>
today, and it brought back bad memories. I was in Delhi the last time
the city was victim to an act of terrorism of an even greater scale. <a href="http://sameer.ddhd.com/2005/11/kuch-baat-hai-ki-hasti.html">This is what I had to say about it</a> then. I just wanted to post a note on this blog reiterating the same feelings.</p>

<p>If the cowards’ intention was to cause fear; then my city was a
wrong choice, is a wrong choice, and always will be a wrong choice.
We’ll be distraught, angry, strained, even broken. But not afraid.
That’s just not how we roll. What they should really be praying for, is
that they don’t fall into the hands of one of us.</p>
