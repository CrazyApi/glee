Glee

Glee is an experimental project and is meant for a very nich√© audience (hackers mostly). So, it is very possible, that at first you find it hard to conceive the utility of Glee.

=== Installation

Right now, Glee is available as a Greasmonkey script for Firefox and a Chrome extension. 

To install the Greasemonkey script, you'll need to have Greasemonkey installed in Firefox. Download the repository as a zip/tar and drag "UserScript/glee.user.js" to Firefox and Greasemonkey should ask for your permission to install it. 

To install as a Chrome extension, you'll need to have the dev build of Google Chrome installed. Download the repository as zip/tar and drag "Chrome/glee_chrome.crx" to Chrome to install it.

=== Usage

General Keys:

Default behavior:

When you enter any text, Glee will search for links on the current page whose text matches your query. If it finds any links, it will highlight them and you can scroll through them by pressing the TAB key. You can open a particular link by pressing ENTER. 

In case Glee doesn't find any links, when you press ENTER, it will either search the text on Google or will directly go to a URL if you entered a URL like twitter.com.
